# AI-Powered Boolean Search Guide

## üéØ Overview

LifeConnect now automatically generates optimized Boolean search queries from your natural language descriptions using AI. You simply describe your memory in plain English, and our AI converts it into precise Boolean search queries for finding connections.

## üöÄ How It Works

### **Automatic Boolean Generation**
1. **Natural Language Input**: Describe your memory in plain English
2. **AI Processing**: Groq API analyzes your description and generates optimized Boolean queries
3. **Precise Search**: The generated Boolean query searches for exact matches
4. **Results**: Find people based on your memory with high precision

### **Example Transformations**

| Natural Language | Generated Boolean Query |
|------------------|------------------------|
| "Worked at Google with Sarah Johnson in 2018" | `"Sarah Johnson" AND "Google" AND "2018"` |
| "Studied Computer Science at Stanford with Mike Chen" | `"Mike Chen" AND "Stanford" AND "Computer Science"` |
| "Lived on Oakwood Street in San Francisco" | `"Oakwood Street" AND "San Francisco"` |
| "Played soccer at Central Park with David in 2019" | `"David" AND "Central Park" AND "soccer" AND "2019"` |

## üß† AI-Powered Features

### **Smart Entity Recognition**
The AI automatically identifies and prioritizes:
- **Names**: People's names (exact matching)
- **Companies**: Workplaces and organizations
- **Locations**: Cities, streets, buildings, parks
- **Job Titles**: Professional roles and positions
- **Time Periods**: Years, dates, and time ranges
- **Activities**: Events, hobbies, and shared experiences

### **Optimized Query Generation**
- **Exact Phrases**: Uses quotes for precise name and company matching
- **Logical Operators**: Applies AND/OR based on context
- **Grouping**: Uses parentheses for related terms
- **Specificity**: Balances precision with search breadth
